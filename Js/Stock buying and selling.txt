You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


Solution:

function getvalue(prices) {

    let max=0;
    for (let p = 0; p < prices.length-1; p++) {
           for(let i=0;i<prices.length-1;i++){
             if(prices[p+i+1]-prices[p]>0){
                 if(max < prices[p+i+1]-prices[p]){
                     max=prices[p+i+1]-prices[p];
                 }
             }
        }

    }
    return max;

};

console.log(getvalue([2,4,1]))
