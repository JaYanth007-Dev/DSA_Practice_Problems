268. Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.






Solution:

function getvalue(nums) {
    if(nums.length == 1 ){
       return (nums[0] - 1 >= 0)
        ? nums[0] - 1
        : nums[0] + 1;
    }
    nums=nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    if(nums[0]==0){
        let min=Math.min(...nums);
        let max=Math.max(...nums)
        let val;
        for(i=min;i<max;i++){
            if(nums[i]!==i){
                console.log("Came",nums[i],i)
                val=i
                break;
            }
        }
        return val!==undefined?val:max+1
    }
   return 0;
    
};

console.log(getvalue([2,3,1,5,0]))
