You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.



Solutions:

Complexity- O(m*n) ~ O(n2) 

var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
        let count=0;
        for(let i of stones){
            for(let j=0;j<jewels.length;j++){     //Or using includes() method is O(n) beacause this method internally uses loop
                if(jewels[j]==i){
                    count++;
                }
            }
        
        }
        return count
};




OR
-Using "Set" for finding and searching operations it will be O(1) to check the element

var numJewelsInStones = function(jewels, stones) {
        let count=0;
        let set=new Set()

        for(let i=0;i<jewels.length;i++){
           set.add(jewels[i]);
        }

        
        for(let i=0;i<stones.length;i++){
            if(set.has(stones[i]){           //complexity O(1)
               count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
};
