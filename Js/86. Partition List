Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-200 <= x <= 200



Solution:

var partition = function(head, x) {
     let small = new ListNode(0), large = new ListNode(0);
    let s = small, l = large;

    while (head) {
        if (head.val < x) {
            s = s.next = head;
        } else {
            l = l.next = head;
        }
        head = head.next;
    }

    l.next = null;         
    s.next = large.next;    

    return small.next;
};
